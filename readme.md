# Testmania Chrome Plugin
This repo is made off the online boilerplate that has outdated dependencies. It is an over weekend project for the hackathon, so please don't judge over the quality!
## Getting started

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies.

```
$ yarn
$ yarn build
```

After the project has been built, a directory named `dist` has been created. You have to add this directory to your Chrome browser:

1. Open Chrome.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable _Developer mode_.
4. Click _Load unpacked_.
5. Select the `dist` directory.
