This repo is made off the online boilerplate that has outdated dependencies. It is an over weekend project for the hackathon, so please don't judge over the quality!
## Getting started

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies.

```
$ yarn
$ yarn build
```

After the project has been built, a directory named `dist` has been created. You have to add this directory to your Chrome browser:

1. Open Chrome.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable _Developer mode_.
4. Click _Load unpacked_.
5. Select the `dist` directory.
